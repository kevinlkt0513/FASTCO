# MongoDB Atlas Search Performance Optimization Case Study

This repository documents the end-to-end process of optimizing a MongoDB Atlas Search query.

The original solution used the general-purpose `wildcard` operator for prefix searching, combined with a separate aggregation stage for sorting. Through analysis and optimization, we migrated to the specialized `autocomplete` operator and leveraged the `$search` stage's built-in `sort` functionality. This resulted in significant performance improvements and more robust features.

## Key Findings

- **Performance Boost**: The optimized query reduced total execution time by approximately **37%**.
- **Architectural Improvement**: Moving the sort operation inside the `$search` stage was a key optimization.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Replacing `wildcard` with `autocomplete` not only improved performance but also added fault tolerance for user typos via the `fuzzy` option.

## Repository Structure

- **[`original_solution/`](./original_solution)**: Contains the original query and its execution plan.
- **[`optimized_solution/`](./optimized_solution)**: Contains the optimized index definition, query, and its execution plan.
- **[`ANALYSIS.md`](./ANALYSIS.md)**: Provides a detailed quantitative comparison and in-depth analysis of the two solutions.

This case study clearly demonstrates how to leverage advanced Atlas Search features to build high-performance, professional-grade search functionality.
